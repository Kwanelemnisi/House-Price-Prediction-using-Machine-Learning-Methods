Comparing machine learning techniques for house price prediction is of paramount importance for selecting accurate 
and efficient models, thereby enhancing decision-making in real estate transactions and advancing the field of 
predictive analytics. This study aims to address this critical need by conducting a comprehensive comparison of three 
prominent machine learning techniques: Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and XGBoost, with a specific focus on 
their predictive performance for house price estimation. The primary objective involves a twofold comparison strategy. 
Firstly, an internal comparison is executed within each technique, where the predictive capabilities of full models and 
reduced models (featuring feature selection) are contrasted. Secondly, an external comparison is performed across the 
three techniques to determine the optimal approach for achieving accurate predictions. Results stemming from this 
investigation unveil a remarkable predictive prowess across all three models. Among the methodologies assessed, XGBoost 
emerges as the top performer, exhibiting the highest predictive accuracy. Further analysis within the XGBoost framework 
highlights the efficacy of the reduced model with feature selection in yielding the most favorable outcomes. Interpretation
of the findings reveals a consistent trend across all three techniques: the reduced model consistently outperforms its full
counterpart. This pattern underscores the pivotal role of feature selection in elevating model performance. Importantly, the
results strongly advocate for the incorporation of feature selection processes, as they positively contribute to the 
predictive precision of the models. This study not only contributes to the selection of suitable machine learning techniques
for house price prediction but also underscores the instrumental role of feature selection in enhancing predictive accuracy. 
The insights presented herein serve as a valuable guide for researchers and professionals seeking reliable predictive models 
in the dynamic realm of real estate.
